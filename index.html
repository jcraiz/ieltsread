    <p>Determine if statements about facts in the text are True, False, or Not Given.</p>
    <div class="strategy-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Read the Whole Statement:</strong> Do not just focus on keywords; understand the entire meaning of the sentence.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyze the Meaning:</strong> Think about what the complete statement implies.</li>

      </ol>
    </div>

    <h3>1.7 Yes / No / Not Given (Y/N/NG)</h3>
    <p>Similar to T/F/NG, but you must identify if a statement agrees with the writer's opinion or claim.</p>
    <div class="strategy-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Use the Same Strategy as T/F/NG:</strong> Follow the same steps of reading and comparing the full meaning.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on the Writer's Opinion:</strong> The key difference is to identify the author's view, not just factual information presented in the text.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    
    <h3>1.8 Matching Sentence Endings</h3>
    <p>Match the first half of a sentence with its correct ending from a list of options.</p>

    </div>
    
    <h3>1.9 Matching Names</h3>
    <p>Match a list of names (e.g., researchers) with statements or findings attributed to them in the text.</p>
    <div class="strategy-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Scan and Underline Names:</strong> Quickly find and mark every instance of the names in the text.</li>
        <li><strong>Start with Less Frequent Names:</strong> Begin with names that appear only once, as they are easier to match.</li>
        <li><strong>Read Around the Name:</strong> Carefully read the sentences describing that person's work or opinion.</li>
        <li><strong>Match to a Statement:</strong> Find the question statement that corresponds to what you just read.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross Off Matched Statements:</strong> Eliminate the statement you have used to simplify the process.</li>

        <li><strong>Move On if Stuck:</strong> Don't waste time on one statement; move to the next and come back later.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h3>1.11 Table / Flowchart Completion</h3>
    <p>Fill in missing information in a table or flowchart using words taken directly from the text.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Read Instructions:</strong> Check the word limit carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>Scan to Locate:</strong> Find the paragraph or section that contains the information needed for the table/chart.</li>
        <li><strong>Read the Section Carefully:</strong> Do not just skim; read in detail to find the exact words.</li>

        <li><strong>Check Spelling:</strong> Ensure there are no spelling mistakes.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h3>1.12 Matching Headings</h3>
    <p>Match the correct heading from a list to each paragraph in the text.</p>
    <div class="strategy-list">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Do This Question FIRST:</strong> This helps you understand the entire text, which makes other questions easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignore the List of Headings:</strong> Initially, do not look at the provided options.</li>
        <li><strong>Read a Paragraph and Write Your OWN Heading:</strong> This forces you to understand the main idea of the paragraph.</li>
        <li><strong>Match Your Heading to the List:</strong> Now, look at the options and see if any match the heading you wrote.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyze Remaining Options:</strong> For paragraphs you couldn't match, read them again and carefully compare the remaining heading options to find the best fit.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>


    <h2 id="keywords-vs-meaning"><span class="section-number">2.</span> Keywords vs. Overall Meaning: A Crucial Distinction</h2>
    <p>Success in IELTS Reading often comes from understanding the difference between scanning for keywords and comprehending the overall meaning of the text.</p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <h3>The Dangers of Relying Only on Keywords</h3>
      <p>Focusing too heavily on keywords is a common trap that can lead to incorrect answers. Hereâ€™s why:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Failure to Understand Meaning:</strong> Focusing on one word means you miss the meaning of the whole sentence, which is essential for T/F/NG questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Missing Synonyms:</strong> You might search for the word "pen" but the text might use "writing instrument," causing you to miss the answer.</li>
        <li><strong>Wasting Time:</strong> A narrow keyword search can cause you to get lost in the text and waste valuable time.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrong Strategy for the Question:</strong> For questions like Matching Headings, understanding the main idea is key, not finding a single word.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
      <h3>The Power of Understanding Overall Meaning</h3>
      <p>True comprehension is essential for the most challenging questions. A successful strategy involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Holistic Reading:</strong> For T/F/NG, read the entire statement to grasp its full meaning before searching the text.</li>
        <li><strong>Summarizing Skills:</strong> For Matching Headings, focus on identifying the main idea of a whole paragraph, not just isolated details.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Skimming:</strong> Skim the text first to understand its general topic and layout, which provides context for all questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Using Keywords for Location Only:</strong> Use keywords as a tool to find the *location* of an answer ("where"), but then read that section carefully to understand *what* the answer is.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight" id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion: Your Path to Success</h2>
        <p>
            Mastering the IELTS Reading test requires a strategic approach. Instead of relying on simplistic tricks like keyword matching, focus on understanding how each of the 12 question types works. By practicing these targeted strategies and prioritizing true comprehension, you can navigate the text efficiently, avoid common traps, and achieve your target score.
